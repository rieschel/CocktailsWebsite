# User testing
When conducting user testing, some issues with the design and functionality of the website were discovered and acted upon. The issues and how the project group dealt with them will be presented here.

Two testing rounds was conducted. The first round tested the mid-project prototype and the functionalities of the website. The second round, formative evaluation testing, focused on the design of the website later in the final stage of the project.

## Prototype testing

### Delete accounts
User testing showed that the website lacked the functionality to delete accounts. A website that has users should always give the users the possibility to delete their accounts. Therefore, this was implemented.

### Drink inspiration
One of the main aspects of the website is to provide users with inspiration. However, the user testing showed that if the user doesn't know what type of drink they are looking for, it becomes difficult to get inspiration from the page. To fix this, a random drink generator was added so that the user can find new drinks even if they have no idea what they are looking for.

### Information about the page
Some users experienced that the page was a bit confusing and that there was not enough information about how the page could be used. Therefore, an information button was implemented. When the button is clicked, a window containing information about the page is presented to the user.

## Formative evaluation testing

### Filter and search
There was some confusion about how the filter by ingredients and search by name functionalities were connected. To make this clearer, the two functions was seperated with drop down windows, were only one window could be seen at the time. Consequently, it became clear that the user can not use both of these functionalities at the same time.

### Filter persistance
User testing showed that the filter was cleared if the filter window was closed, but the results from the filtering was still shown. Therefore, filter persistance was implemented. This means that the same checkboxes are checked even if the filter menu is closed and opened again. To clear the filter, the user can click reset filter.

### Rate drinks
Before the user evaluation, users could rate drinks with a slider and the rating was shown with a number between 1 and 10. Users found this a bit confusing and not very aesthetically pleasing. To make the ratings simpler, the slider and rating display was replaced by five stars which showed the rating. The user can also click on a star to give a rating.

### Save drinks
Earlier in the project, users could save drinks by clicking on a button that said "Save drink". User testing showed that this was unecessary text, and that it would be better to use a symbol. Another issue that came up is that users could not see which drinks they had saved in the search view. Therefor, this button was replaced by a little heart in the corner of the picture of the drink, which was filled is the drink was saved and a conture if the drink was not saved. To save a drink, the user can click on the heart.
